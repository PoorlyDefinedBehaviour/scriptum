## Data Modeling with Algebraic Data Types (ADTs)

Modeling data in functional programming means to compose simple types to arbitrarily complex composite ones, while these types have a strong foundation in math. The goal of this chapter is to give you a first impression of this approach and its mathematical roots.

### A short OOP detour

As opposed to object oriented programming data and behavior are strictly decoupled from each other in the functional paradigm. This has two major advantages:

* it allows functions to be stateless and thus globally declared
* it leads to more explicit data dependencies in general

Instead of writing statements and assigning intermediate results to variables a functional programmer composes functions - not only unary pure ones but all kinds of functions. The resulting compositions have a strict order caused by data dependencies between the involved functions.

### Algebraic data types

Algebraic data types are the only means necessary in the functional paradigm to construct all kinds of composite data structures. Unsurprisingly they are composable and may have recursive definitions. The following sections cover the most important ADT classes.

#### Sum types

A sum type, also known as tagged union, can have alternative shapes called variants, where only a single variant can exist simultaneously. Variants are tagged in order to distinguish them from one another at runtime. Scriptum supplies the `union` auxiliary function to facilitate the construction of tagged unions in Javascript:

```javascript
const union = type => (tag, o) =>
  (o[type] = type, o.tag = tag.name || tag, o);

const Bool = union("Bool"); // type constructor

// value constructors

const False = Bool("False", {});
const True = Bool("True", {});

False; // {Bool: true, tag: "False"}
True; // {Bool: true, tag: "True"}
```
The `Bool` tagged union type from the above example can either be `True` or `False`. Please note that the `Bool` property is required, because in the second part of this course we will use scriptum along with Typescript. Such a property allows Typescript's structural type system to distinguish different union types with an accidentally identical structure.

Here is another tagged union which includes `None` and `Some<A>` as variants. It is a more explicit and less error prone alternative to Javascript's `null` type:

```javascript
const Option = union("Option"); // type constructor

// value constructors

const None = Option("None", {});
const Some = some => Option(Some, {some});

None; // {Option: true, tag: "None"}
Some(5); // {Option: true, tag: "Some", some: 5}
```
A crucial property of sum types is that they are closed, i.e. you cannot add new variants at runtime. Usually a compiler enfoces this rule, but in dynamically typed Javascript sticking to this rule is just a convention.

#### Product types

A product type has only one shape but can group several data fields, which are independent of one another. Scriptum supplies the `record` auxiliary function to facilitate the construction of product types in Javascript:

```javascript
const record = (type, o) =>
  (o.type = type.name || type, o);

const Point = x => y => record(Point, {x, y});

Point(1) (2); // {Point: true, x: 1, y, 2}
```
`Point<A, A>` contains two fields with values of the same type.

#### Void type

The `Void` type has no inhabitants, i.e. it has no value. We cannot express such a type in Javascipt due to the lack of a static type system. The closest thing we can get is only partially applying scriptum's union type constructor:

```javascript
const Void = union("Void");
```
Since there is no value constructor we cannot construct a value of type `Void`. This seems to be absurd, but later in this chapter we will use `Void` to demonstrate the algebra of ADTs.

#### Unit type

The `Unit` type has exactly one inhabitant:

```javascript
const Unit = record("Unit", {});
```
Javascript's native unit types are `null` and `undefined`.

#### The algebra of ADTs

What exactly is the algebra of algebraic data types? Here is a simple algebraic notation to express it:

* `+` Sum
* `*` Product
* `0` Void
* `1` Unit
* `X`/`Y` Singleton

Let us encode some ADTs with this notation:

```
Bool         = True    | False            ~ 1 + 1
Option<A>    = None    | Some<A>          ~ 1 + X
Either<A, B> = Left<A> | Right<B>         ~ X + Y
Point<A, A>                               ~ X * X
List<A>      = Nil     | Cons<A, List<A>> ~ 1 + X * List<A>
```
It turns out that every valid ADT can be expressed in algebraic notation and the result of this expression is the cardinality of the type, i.e. how many inhabitants it has. The names of ADT classes simply reflect the arithmetic operation that is used to determine the cardinality of possible types of this class. `X`/`Y` are placeholders that can be replaced with the number of values of their type, as soon as this type is actually provided. Moreover, the `List` ADT includes a recursive type definition.

#### Do the algebraic laws hold?

Let us verify if the algebraic identity law holds for ADTs?

```javascript
// 0 + x = x

const Foo = union("Foo");

const Bar = x => Foo("Bar", Void);
const Bat = x => Foo("Bat", {x});

Bar(123); // no value
Bat(123); // Foo {x: 123}
```
We can only construct `Foo` values of the `Bat` variant, hence `0 + X = X` holds.

```javascript
// 0 * x = 0

const Foo = y => record("Foo", {x: Void, y});

Foo(123); // no overall value, because the `x` property has no value
```
We cannot construct a single `Foo` value, hence `0 * a = 0` holds. For the sake of simplicity I will not verify the other algebraic laws for addition/multiplication. This section might have been a bit handwavy, but please bear my attempt in mind to address a non-mathematical audience as well.

### When to use sums and when to use products?

Sums are the dual of products but when do we choose one over the other? We can state the following as a rule of thumb:

* if two data components are interdependent, a sum type should be used to avoid invalid combinations
* if two data components are independent of each other a product type should be used to allow all combinations

A computation that may fail can either yield a result value or an error message. Both data components depend on each other, because they are mutually exclusive:

left | right | valid
---- | ----- | ------
string | null | true
null | data | true
string | data | false
null | null | false

We encode such computations with a sum type to make illegal states unrepresentable:

```javascript
const Either = union("Either");

const Left = left => Either(Left, {left}); // error case
const Right = right => Either(Right, {right}); // right case

const safeDiv = x => y =>
  y === 0
    ? Left("division by zero")
    : Right(x / y);
    
safeDiv(2) (6); // Either {tag: "Right", right: 3}
safeDiv(2) (0); // Either {tag: "Left", left: "division by zero"}
```
Using `Either` only valid combinations of the involved data components are possible.

Here is another example with data components which are completely independent of each other:

```javascript
const Time = h => m => s => record(Time, {h, m, s});

Time(11) (59) (59); // {Time: true, h: 11, m: 59, s: 59}
```
All combinations of hours, minutes and seconds are valid. The number of possible combinations is only limited by the product of the three data fields `Time<Nat, Nat, Nat> ~ Nat * Nat * Nat`. Hence we encode the data structure using a product type.

### Sums of products

The last examples were quite simple and rather contrived. If we compose sums and products to more complex compositions a pattern naturally evolves: A sum of products or alternatives of records to put it another way. If we recap that sum types offer a choice by declaring alternative value constructors and each constructor can form a product type by expecting more than one argument are the natural result.

Let us examine a simple example of a sum of product, which additionally includes a recursive definition: The `List` type:

```javascript
const List = union("List");

const Nil = List("Nil", {});
const Cons = head => tail => List(Cons, {head, tail});

const listFold = f => acc => {
  const go = tx =>
    match(tx, {
      Nil: _ => acc,
      Cons: ({head, tail}) => f(head) (go(tail))
    });

  return go;
};

const listSum = listFold(x => acc => x + acc) (0);

const tx = Cons(1) (Cons(2) (Cons(3) (Nil)));

listSum(tx); // 6
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/TerribleRoughSorting)

`List` consists of the sum of its two data constructors `Nil` and `Cons` where the latter is a product type, because it expects two arguments. The cardinality of `List` is calculated by `List<A> ~ 1 + X * List<A>`. As you can see the type is defined in terms of itself. Recursive type definitions are a very powerful mechanism to define more complex types.

In the next example I demonstrate the power of the sums of products pattern by encoding the idea of either or both as an ADT:

```javascript
const Triple = x => y => z => [x, y, z];

const These_ = union("These");
const This = _this => These_(This, {this: _this});
const That = that => These_(That, {that});
const These = _this => that => These_(These, {this: _this, that});

// ARRAY

const arrAlign = f => xs => ys => {
  const go = (acc, i) => {
    if (i >= xs.length && i >= ys.length)
      return acc;

    else if (i >= ys.length)
      return go(arrSnoc(acc) (f(This(xs[i]))), i + 1);

    else if (i >= xs.length)
      return go(arrSnoc(acc) (f(That(ys[i]))), i + 1);

    else
      return go(arrSnoc(acc) (f(These(xs[i]) (ys[i]))), i + 1);
  };

  return go([], 0);
};

const arrSnoc = xs => x =>
  xs.concat([x]);

const Pair = x => y => [x, y];

// polymorphic align/zip functions

const liftAlign = align => f => x => y =>
  align(tx =>
    match(tx, {
      This: ({this: x_}) => f(x_) (y),
      That: ({that: y_}) => f(x) (y_),
      These: ({this: x_, that: y_}) => f(x_) (y_)
    }));

const zipPad = align => liftAlign(align) (Pair);

const liftAlign3 = align => f => x => y => z => xs => ys =>
  align(tx =>
    match(tx, {
      This: ({this: [x_, y_]}) => f(x_) (y_) (z),
      That: ({that: z_}) => f(x) (y) (z_),
      These: ({this: [x_, y_], that: z_}) => f(x_) (y_) (z_)}))
        (zipPad(align) (x) (y) (xs) (ys));

const zipPad3 = align => liftAlign3(align) (Triple);

// MAIN

const main = zipPad3(arrAlign) ("") (0) (false);

main(
  ["foo", "bar"])
    ([2, 4, 6, 8])
      ([true, true]); // [["foo", 2, true], ["bar", 4, true], ["", 6, false], ["", 8, false]]
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/FocusedDeepCodeview)

Do not be intimidated by the complexity of this algorithm. It requires quite a bit of experience to understand or even write such an extendable composition. This course will hopefully help you to get there. The cardinality of `These<A, B>` is calculated by `These<A, B> ~ X + Y + X * Y`.

### The curse of hierarchies

Imagine a language that only allows the definition of new data types in a way that you can merely add information in order to model the world. How would such a model look like? In the following example we start with a data type `Foo`. Later we realize that we sometimes need another data component. We can either add information to `Foo` or create a new data type. Since both data components sometimes (but not always) have to be grouped in our hypothetical example we decide to extend `Foo`:

```javascript
class Foo {
  constructor(x) {this.x = x}
}

class Bar extends Foo {
  constructor(x, y) {super(x); this.y = y}
}

Bar(123, "abc");
Bar(123, null); // ouch
```
With data types that only can add information we inevitably wind up with inflexible type hierarchies, which tend to be inadequate to model the real, chaotic world.

### ADTs with lazy property access

We can easily encode ADTs with lazy semantics in Javascript using object getters and setters:

```javascript
const lazyProp = (k, v) => o =>
  Object.defineProperty(o, k, {
    get: function() {delete o[k]; return o[k] = v()},
    configurable: true,
    enumerable: true});

const Lazy = lazy =>
  record(Lazy, lazyProp("lazy", lazy) ({}));

const log = x => (console.log(x), x);

const main = Lazy(() => log(2 * 3));

// nothing logged so far

main.lazy + main.lazy; // logs 6 once and yields 12
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/GlisteningPalegreenAnalyst)

`main.lazy` is only evaluated when needed and its result is memoized so that it can be shared with subsequent property accesses.

### Pattern matching

Functions that expect tagged unions must always consider all possible cases. Pattern matching is a unification algorithm along with local bindings and special syntax that guarantees case exhaustiveness. It has to be implemented at the language level to ensure a succinct syntax and compatibility for all native and custom data types. Unfortunately Javascript does not ship with pattern matching. However, scriptum supplies a `match` auxiliary function which relies on duck typing and destructuring assignment to come as close as possible to the pattern matching experience:

```javascript
const match = (tx, o) =>
  o[tx.tag] (tx);
    
const Option = union("Option");

const None = Option("None", {});
const Some = some => Option(Some, {some});

const option = none => some => tx =>
  match(Option, tx, {
    None: _ => none,
    Some: ({some: x}) => some(x)
  });

const main = option(0) (x => x * x);

main(None); // 0
main(Some(5)); // 25
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/BogusFullButtons)

`match` only works with tagged unions and it does not prevent us from supplying non-exhaustive patterns. This will change as soon as we start working with Typescript.

### Smart constructors

A smart constructor narrows the value range of a normal constructor beyond what is possible with the type system of your language:

```javascript
const Natural = n =>
  n < 0 ? _throw(new TypeError("unexpected negative number"))
    : n % 1 !== 0 ? _throw(new TypeError("unexpected floating point number"))
    : record(Natural, n);

Natural(7); // Natural<2>
Natural(-1); // type error
Natural(1.01); // type error
```
Smart constructors are particularly helpful in a language with an unsound type system like Javascript.

### Type wrappers

Type wrappers are used to create values of built-in types with additional semantics at the type level. While handling of such values is a bit more laborious, it helps to emphasize the intention of your code:

```javascript
// instead of constructing ambiguous values

const x = 20,
  y = "a"
  z = 1.59;

// create meaningful ones

const x = DegreeCelsius(20),
  y = AnsiLetter("a"),
  z = DollarAmount(1.59);
```
You should do type wrapping on a regular basis. It is a sign of high code quality. Please keep also in mind that we often manage large compositions in functional programming which lack descriptive intermediate values. The more important it is to have meaningful runtime types during debugging.
