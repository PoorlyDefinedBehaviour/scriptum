## Linear Data Flow and Flat Composition Syntax

There are two ways to obtain method chaining in Javascript, either by relying on the [prototype system](https://repl.it/@scriptum/CheapTurquoiseUnit) or by using plain old Javascript [object factories](https://repl.it/@scriptum/RegalTriflingFactor). While the former is language specific and encodes the idea of object oriented programming, object factories are quite inefficient as soon as continuously to be created objects include a larger numbers of methods. In this chapter we will therefore stick with function composition and explore techniques to reduce nesting.

### Prefix notation and S-expressions

Functions in Javascript are written in prefix notation, i.e. the name comes first and is followed by the argument list. Prefix notation leads to nested functions calls, which resemble Lisp style S-expressions:

```Javascript
const sub = x => y => x - y;

sub(
  sub(
    sub(
      sub(1) (2)) (3)) (4)) (5); // -13
```
We can avoid nested syntax using native operators, which are written in infix position:

```Javascript
1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5; // -13
```
The evaluation order of expressions with infix operators is determined by their precedence and associativity. Subtraction, for instance, has a higher precedence than multiplication

```Javascript
1 + 2 * 3;   // 7 (predefined precedence)
(1 + 2) * 3; // 9 (enforced precedence)
```
and is left-associative

```Javascript
1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5;         // -13 (left-associative by default)
(1 - (2 - (3 - (4 - 5)))); // 3 (right-associative by parentheses)
```
Unfortunately, we cannot define custom infix operators in Javascript but have to resort to operator functions, which are again in prefix position. So are we condemned to build nested S-expressions?

### Reduce nesting with function composition

A bunch of arity aware function composition functions allow us to reduce the syntactic noise:

```javascript
const comp ...
const comp3 ...

const comp4 = f => g => h => i => x =>
  f(g(h(i(x))));

const comp5 ...
const comp6 ...
...

const sub = x => y => x - y;

comp4(
  sub(1))
  (sub(2))
  (sub(3))
  (sub(4))
  (5); // (1 - (2 - (3 - (4 - 5)))) = 3
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/CheapDrearyGenre)

Since function application is not associative we need a set of inverted `comp` combinators and another operator function with its arguments flipped:

```javascript
const pipe...
const pipe3...

const pipe4 = i => h => g => f => x =>
  f(g(h(i(x))));

const pipe5...
const pipe6...
...

const sub_ = y => x => x - y;

pipe4(
  sub_(2))
  (sub_(3))
  (sub_(4))
  (sub_(5))
  (1); // ((((1 - 2) - 3) - 4) - 5) = -13
```

### Variadic function composition

Arity aware combinators are somewhat impractical, because we need to change the combinator as soon as the number of composed functions does. Why not use variadic combinators instead?

```javascript
const comp = f => g => x => f(g(x));
const id = x => x;

const compn = (...fs) =>
  fs.reduce((acc, x) => comp(acc) (x), id);

const dec = x => x - 1;
const sqr = x => x * x;
const repeat = s => n => s.repeat(n);

compn(
  repeat("x"),
  dec,
  dec,
  dec,
  dec,
  sqr) (3); // "xxxxx"
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/SpecializedWeepyVirus)

Or even a curried version:

```javascript
const compn = f =>
  Object.assign(g => compn(x => f(g(x))), {run: f});

const dec = x => x - 1;
const sqr = x => x * x;
const repeat = s => n => s.repeat(n);

compn(
  repeat("x"))
  (dec)
  (dec)
  (dec)
  (dec)
  (sqr).run(3); // "xxxxx"
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/OblongYellowishGame)

The problem is that you cannot give them a proper type using the common type systems available for Javascript, at least not without type coersions. You might argue that this does not matter for untyped Javascript, but I will not recommend code in this course which cannot be typed for later use.

Here is a viable alternative:

```javascript
const compn = (...fs) => {
  switch (fs.length) {
    case 2: return comp(fs[0]) (fs[1]);
    case 3: return comp3(fs[0]) (fs[1]) (fs[2]);
    case 4: return comp4(fs[0]) (fs[1]) (fs[2]) (fs[3]);
    case 5: return comp5(fs[0]) (fs[1]) (fs[2]) (fs[3]) (fs[4]);
    case 6: return comp6(fs[0]) (fs[1]) (fs[2]) (fs[3]) (fs[4]) (fs[5]);
    default: throw new TypeError("invalid argument number");
  }
};
```
The overloaded `compn` version might not be the most elegant solution but it can be typed and works reliable. If we need curried function composition we can still resort to the individual arity aware combinators. I use this simple technique for various types in the scriptum library.

### Utilize prefix combinators to mimic infix operators

There is another set of arity aware combinators that come in handy when dealing with application hell:

```javascript
const infix3 ...

const infix4 = (v, f, w, g, x, h, y, i, z) =>
  i(h(g(f(v) (w)) (x)) (y)) (z);

const infix5 ...
const infix6 ...
...

const infixr3 ...

const infixr4 = (v, f, w, g, x, h, y, i, z) =>
  f(v) (g(w) (h(x) (i(y) (z))));

const infixr5 ...
const infixr6 ...
...

sub = x => y => x - y;

infix4(
  1, sub,
  2, sub,
  3, sub,
  4, sub, 5)); // -13

infixr4(
  1, sub,
  2, sub,
  3, sub,
  4, sub, 5); // 3
 ```
 [run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/DevotedRecentMotion)
 
`infix` et al. mimic infix notation with prefix functions. This is again not that elegant but effective. There are also overloaded `infixn`, `infixrn` and a simple binary `infix` combinator, of course.

### More involved forms of composition

Keeping the syntax of ordinary function composition flat is not even half of the deal. There is a wide range of different sorts of more complex compositions in functional programming. Fortunately, we can adapt the simple overload mechanism presented in this chapter to cover most of them. You will learn more about this topic in the correpsonding chapters of this course.

### Break the composition

Creating large compositions leads to dense, concise code without intermediate values. While point-free code has its merits you should not overstretch its usage, just like with any other technique. It is all about the right balance to obtain optimally readable code at the end. So do not feel bad about breaking up your composition and store the intermediate results in explicit values. If it serves readability just do it.
