## Lazy Evaluation on Demand

The functional paradigm favors a lazy evaluation strategy, which usually means that expressions are evaluated

* only when needed
* just enough
* only once

The next sections will discuss each point in detail. Please note that lazy evaluation is not a prerequisite for the functional paradigm.

### Call-by-name evaluation

Call-by-name evaluation passes non-evaluated arguments to functions and proceeds with their evaluation only if the results are actually needed within the function body. Here is an exmaple of a **hypothetical** call-by-name evaluation strategy in Javascript:

```javascript
const foo = x => y => {
  if (y === 0)
    return 0;
    
  else return x / y;
};

const bar = foo(2 * 5) (1 + 2); // A
//              ^^^^^   ^^^^^ sub-expressions

const bat = foo(2 * 5) (2 * 3 - 6); // A
//              ^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^ sub-expressions

console.log(bar); // B
console.log(bat); // C
```
With the call-by-name strategy both sub-expressions `x` and `y` are not evaluated but passed to `foo` as is (`A`). Moreover, the evaluation of `foo` itself is suspended. Only if `foo`'s result is actually needed the evaluation is resumed (`B`, `C`). In the example above I enforce evaluation by logging to the console.

As opposed to this most common object oriented and multi-paradigm languages pursue a call-by-value evaluation strategy. Call-by-value evaluates all argument sub-expressions passed to a function just before the function is called, even if an argument is not used at all.

Here is another important difference between both strategies:

```javascript
const _throw = e => {
  throw e;
};

const foo = x => y => {
  if (y === 0)
    return 0;
    
  else return x / y;
};

const bar = foo(_throw(new TypeError())) (2 * 3 - 6);
//              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^ sub-expressions

console.log(bar);
```
In an eager environment like Javascript the function call of `foo` would immediately terminate the program with an error. In a lazy one though, the function call would merely yield and log zero, because the erroneous first argument would never be evaluated. This shows that call-by-name evaluation is more expressive.

Call-by-name evaluation starts with the reduction of a term from the outside inwards and is also referred to as non-strict evaluation. This is opposed to strict evaluation that starts reducing a term from the inside outwards.

### Weak Head Normal Form (WHNF)

Lazy evaluation also means to evaluate sub-expressions just enough, i.e. to suspend the evaluation as early as possible. If the outermost level of an sub-expression is a lambda abstraction or constructor, it need not be further reduced. Such expressions are in WHNF, that is, they may contain unevaluated sub-expressions, sometimes also referred to as thunks:

```
// expressions in Weak Head Normal Form

  [1 + 2]
// ^^^^^ thunk
x => x + 1
concat("h") ("e" + "llo")
//           ^^^^^^^^^^^ thunk

// expressions in Normal Form

1 + 2
(x => x + 1) (5)
"h" + "e" + "llo"
```
Please note that `[]` is actually a constructor call, because the literal form is just syntactic sugar for applying the array constructor.

### Sharing

Lazy evaluation would be very inefficient if it had to evaluate the same argument sub-expression each time it is used by a function. For that reason the result of an once evaluated sub-expressions is stored and shared within the same scope:

```javascript
const foo = x => [
  x + x,
  x - x,
  x * x];

console.log(foo(2 + 3));
```
Logging `foo`'s result value triggers the evaluation of `2 + 3` only once, even though it is used six times within `foo`. By the way, non-strict evaluation together with sharing is also called call-by-need evaluation.

### Lambda abstractions

Another form of non-strictness is introduced by ordinary functions. Functions are in normal form but we can further evaluate them by passing the required arguments. From an eagerly evaluated language perspektive this behavior resembles the call-by-name evaluation strategy. As a matter of fact we can wrap an expression in a function in Javascript to render it less strict. If we add memoization to such a function we come close to the call-by-need evaluation strategy. However, functions always need an explicit function call to trigger the evaluation, whereas thunks are implicitly evaluated.

#### Eta abstractions

The two expressions `f` and `x => f(x)` do not exhibit the same behavior if eager evaluation is involved like with Javascript. The latter may render a function idempotent, because it adds a layer of non-strictness:

```javascript
const foldMap = f => acc => ix => {
  for (let [i, x] of ix)
    acc = f(acc) (x);

  return acc;
};

const arrSnoc = xs => x =>
  (xs.push(x), xs); // side effect

const mapToArr =
  foldMap(arrSnoc) ([]);

const mapToArr_ = ix =>
//                ^^
  foldMap(arrSnoc) ([]) (ix);
//                      ^^^^

const foo = new Map([[0, "foo"], [1, "bar"], [2, "baz"]]);

mapToArr(foo);
mapToArr_(foo);

mapToArr(foo); // ["foo", "bar", "baz", "foo", "bar", "baz"]
mapToArr_(foo); // ["foo", "bar", "baz"]
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/MeanNoxiousChord)

`mapToArr_` gets a fresh array accumulator each time it is called and hence keeps the side effect caused by `arrSnoc` local. Adding redundant lambda abstractions to a function is called eta abstraction. The opposite operation is called eta reduction.

#### Function composition

Function composition allows you to define new non-strict behavior out of existing non-strict behavior:

```javascript
const comp = f => g => x => f(g(x));
const flip = f => y => x => f(x) (y);

const sqr = x => x * x;
const strRepeat = n => s => s.repeat(n);

const main = comp(
  flip(strRepeat) ("Hi"))
    (sqr);

// nothing evaluated yet

main(2); // "HiHiHiHi"
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/WebbedDryDiskdrive)

Function composition is like creating mere descriptions of computations instead of actually applying them.

#### Continuation passing style

We can further defer the evaluation of function composition by encoding the algorithm in continuation passing style, where the last formal parameter of each function is the continuation:

```javascript
const compk = f => g => x => k => g(x) (f) (k);
const flipk = f => y => x => k => f(x) (y) (k);
const id = x => x;

const sqrk = x => k => k(x * x);
const strRepeatk = n => s => k => k(s.repeat(n));

const main = compk(
  flipk(strRepeatk) ("Hi"))
    (sqrk);

// nothing evaluated yet

const main_ = main(2);

// still not evaluated yet

main_(id); // "HiHiHiHi"
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/AppropriateBestObjectmodel)

Continuation passing style is like function composition but adds another level of non-strictness and enables us to manage the control flow more precisely. We will learn about CPS in a subsequent chapter of this course.

### From nullary functions to implicit thunks

Using the inherent laziness of functions for our own benefit is a very powerful technique and one of the major effects that the paradigm has on your code. However, we would like to have a more fine-grained control over the evaluation time of an arbitrarily expression. Javascript pursues an eager evaluation strategy, that is, we need to mimic laziness somehow. The usual approach is to utilize nullary functions for that matter:

```javascript
const comp = f => g => x => () => f(g(x));
//                          ^^ nullary function
```
Nullary functions are also referred to as thunks in Javascript. They have a negative impact on the call side, because the consumer of such code needs to apply each thunk accordingly, even though there are no arguments. One way to abstract from nullary function application would be to rely on a special type (namely a functor) but at the price that laziness would be restricted to values of this very type. Is there any alternative way to enable lazy evaluation along with ordinary expressions in general? There is indeed a way, provided you are willing to intercept property accesses and functions calls with the `Proxy` interface:

```javascript
// implicit thunks (simplified version)

const thunk = f =>
  new Proxy(f, new ThunkProxy());

const strict = thunk => {
  while (thunk && thunk[THUNK])
    thunk = thunk.valueOf();

  return thunk;
};

class ThunkProxy {
  constructor() {
    this.memo = undefined;
  }

  get(g, k) {
    if (this.memo === undefined) {
      this.memo = g();
      
      while (this.memo && this.memo[THUNK])
        this.memo = this.memo.valueOf();
    }

    if (k === THUNK)
      return true;

    else if (k === Symbol.toPrimitive)
      return this.memo[Symbol.toPrimitive];

    else if (k === "valueOf")
      return () => this.memo;

    else return this.memo[k];
  }
}

const THUNK = "thunk";

// auxiliary functions

const taggedLog = tag => x =>
  (console.log(tag, x), x);

const add = x => y =>
  thunk(() => taggedLog("add") (x + y));

const mul = x => y =>
  thunk(() => taggedLog("mul") (x * y));

// MAIN

const main = add(add(2) (3)) (mul(4) (5)); // WHNF
//               ^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^ not immediately evaluated

// nothing logged yet!

// enforce evaluation
strict(main); // logs 5, 20, 25 and yields 25
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/FarawayImmediateSyntax)

Please note that this is essentially the example from the beginning of this chapter but the presumably lazily evaluated version. Is this full-fledged laziness? Let us verify whether we meet all requirements, namely normal order, WHNF and sharing, before we get too excited:

```javascript
// auxiliary functions

const taggedLog = tag => x =>
  (console.log(tag, x), x);

const add = x => y =>
  thunk(() => taggedLog("2 add 3 =") (x + y));

const mul = x => y =>
  thunk(() => taggedLog("5 mul 5 =") (x * y));

const foo = x => [
//Ë… here x is actually evaluated (A)
  x + x,
//    ^ here x is shared (C)
  x - x,
//^   ^ here x is shared (C)
  mul(x) (x)];
//^^^^^^^^^^ thunk (D)
  
// MAIN

const r = add(2) (3); // thunk

// add is still an unevaluated thunk

const main = foo(r); // logs "2 add 3 = 5" and yields [10, 0, thunk]
//           ^^^^^^ WHNF (B)

// mul is still an unevaluated thunk

// enforce evaluation
strict(main[2]); // logs "5 mul 5 = 25" and yields 25
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/EasygoingUnhealthyAttribute)

`foo` evaluates its argument `add(2) (3)` only when needed (`A`), that is, when its result is used the first time within `foo`. `main` is in WHNF (`B`), because it contains an unevaluated thunk. `foo` evaluates `add(2) (3)` only once and shares the result (`C`). The result array of `foo` remains in WHNF, i.e. is evaluated just enough (`D`). We have achieved proper lazy evaluation in Javascript. This is huge! Let us discover some use cases for our lazy evaluation on demand strategy.

#### Guarded recursion

With our new tool at hand we can construct a lazy right associative fold, where the recursive step is wrapped in an implicit thunk. Such a lazy fold gives as stack safe recursion for free, provided the reducer function is lazy in its second argument:

```javascript
// ARRAY

const arrToList = xs =>
  tailRec((acc, i) =>
    i < 0
      ? Base(acc)
      : Step(Cons(xs[i]) (acc), i - 1))
        (Nil, xs.length - 1);

const arrFoldr_ = f => acc => xs => {
  const go = i =>
    i === xs.length
      ? acc
      : f(xs[i]) (thunk(() => go(i + 1)));

  return go(0);
};

const arrTake = n => xs => {
  const go = (acc, {head, tail}) =>
    head === undefined || acc.length === n
      ? acc
      : go(arrSnoc(head) (acc), tail);

  return go([], xs);
};

const arrSnoc = x => xs =>
  xs.concat([x]);

// trampoline

const tailRec = f => (...args) => {
    let step = f(...args);

    while (step.tag !== "Base")
      step = f(...step.args);

    return step.x;
};

const Base = x =>
  ({tag: "Base", x});

const Step = (...args) =>
  ({tag: "Step", args});

// auxiliary functions

const comp = f => g => x => f(g(x));
const add = x => y => x + y;
const neg = n => -n;

// MAIN

const xs = Array(1e5)
  .fill(0)
  .map((_, i) => i + 1);

const ys = arrToList(xs);

const main = listFoldr_(
  comp(Cons) (neg))
    (Nil)
      (ys);

main; // {head: -1, tail: thunk}
arrTake(5) (main); // [-1, -2, -3, -4, -5]

const main2 = listFoldr_( // stack overflow
  add)
    (0)
      (ys);

const main3 = arrFoldr_( // stack overflow
  comp(arrSnoc) (neg))
    ([])
      (xs);
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/ShadowyFlimsySmalltalk)

This property is referred to as guarded recursion, which is equivalent to tail call elimination modulo cons in eagerly evaluated languages. We will learn about the latter in a later chapter of this course. `main2` is not stack safe, because `add` is strict in both of its arguments. `main3` is not stack safe, because guarded recursion only works with purely functional data types like single linked `List`s, not with mutable `Array`s.

#### Infinite recursion

Lazy evaluation enables infinite recursions of otherwise non-terminating algorithms. `fix` has an infinite definition to express anonymous recursion:

```javascript
const fix = f => thunk(() => f(fix(f)));

const fact = fix(go => n =>
  n === 0
    ? 1
    : n * go(n - 1));

fact(5); // 120
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/MurkyDetailedAutosketch)

The next algorithm infinitely applies a function to its previous result and accumulates the results in an array:

```javascript
// infinite recursion

const iterate = f => x =>
  Cons(x) (thunk(() => iterate(f) (f(x))));

// auxiliary function

const dbl = x => x * 2;

// MAIN

const main = iterate(dbl) (1);

arrTake(10) (main); // [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512]
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/SilkyRosyGenres#index.js)

Given this mechanism we can defined a stream of infinite Fibonacci numbers:

```javascript
const fibs = [0, [1, thunk(() => {
  const next = ([x, [y, ys]]) =>
    [x + y, thunk(() => next([y, ys]))];

  return next(fibs);
})]];

fibs[1] [1] [1] [1] [1] [1] [1] [1] [1] [1] [0]; // 55
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/WiltedDarkseagreenCoolingfan)

#### Iterator-like data streams

Eagerly evaluated languages need iterators to lazily traverse a potentially infinite data structure. In a lazy evaluated setting we have incremental operations for free:

```javascript
// OPTION

const Option = union("Option");

const None = Option("None", {});

const Some = some => Option(Some, {some});

// ARRAY

const arrTakeWith = f => n => xs => {
  const go = (acc, {head, tail}) =>
    head === undefined || acc.length === n
      ? acc
      : go(arrSnoc(f(head)) (acc), tail);

  return go([], xs);
};

// auxiliary function

const fst = ([x, y]) => x;

// MAIN

const iterator = f => init => {
  const go = tx =>
    match(tx, {
      None: _ => Nil,
      Some: ({some: x}) => Cons(x) (thunk(() => go(f(x))))
    });
    
  return go(Some(init));
};

const main = iterator(
  ([x, i]) => i === 6
    ? None
    : Some([x * i, i + 1]))
        ([1, 1]);

arrTakeWith(fst) (10) (main); // [1, 1, 2, 6, 24, 120]
```
[run code](https://repl.it/@scriptum/TurboVeneratedLock)

This is just a naive implementation of an imperative-iterator-like infinite data structure, which is based on a lazy `List`. It behaves like an imperative iterator in terms of memory usage and the ability to encode infinite data streams. However, `iterator` is not equivalent to its imperative counterpart, because it is pure and thus can be cloned or composed. Besides it do not allow performing side effects. Laziness makes it possible to operate incrementally on data streams without requiring an explicit data structure for this purpose.

#### Separating declaration from production

In general, the common theme here is that with lazily evaluated infinite data structures you can separate the declaration of a structure from its actual production. This characteristics frees you from knowing upfront which values the structure needs to include. You can make this desicion later when you actually know which values are interesting to look at. In other words it is not the producer of a data structure anymore that determines the values but the consumer. Delaying this decision is clearly a smart move.

#### Enforcing evaluation

If we use functions with result expressions in WHNF, we sometimes need a means to enforce evaluation. This is the purpose of the `strict` combinator, which also handles arbitrarily nested thunks:

```javascript
const THUNK = "thunk";

const strict = thunk => {
  while (thunk[THUNK])
    thunk = thunk.valueOf();

  return thunk;
};
```
### Evaluation order

The evaluation order in a non-strict setting is based on the following aspects:

* data dependencies
* operator precedence
* operator associativity
* reduction from outside inwards

While the first three points also apply to a strict environment, the reduction runs the other way around. This is why the evaluation order of a strict language is often deterministic at compile time, whereas the order of a non-strict language is unpredictable: You can only know at runtime if and when a sub-expression is actually needed.

Since you cannot count on the evaluation order in a non-strict language, it requires means to determine such an order explicitly. It may come as a surprise for you that this means is called a monad.
